# CompInv_Nano328Pv2
This project is about how to make a Variable Frequency Drive for 3 phase squirel cage motors from old OSAKA Air Conditioner 

For the project I used arduino Nano board A328p and IPM50 IGBT board from old OSAKA AC - the main part in this board is MITSIBISHI PM50CTJ060-3 IGBT MODULE. 

This device is far away from such industrial devices but it works pretty well and can be used for educational purposes.
